Project summary

We developed a game wicht is a simulation based on a trip to space, there users will face the diferent problems that the astromauts could suffer on their
travels. In doing so we want to aproach the user to the NASA enviroment and peak their interest on space related matters in hope of creating a new
relationship with people who have never shown interest in the matters. We are triying to design a platform that allows users to explore space travel
stresses and learn how NASA is solving them and how they are developing new experiments with diverse organisms for the development of new or better 
solutions for these problems. From our point is paramount to make it accesible to newcommers and youth.
